    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      All my children were asleep until that lightening flash and rumble of the thunder which 
      shook the house as if it was falling down.
      <br> So we all jumped out of bed to see what was the matter. There was nothing but rain. 
      So we all went back to bed and slept the rest of the night in peace.
